## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- HTML, CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Deploying React app to Github practice until it gets more efficient. Displaying the hero image is an issue as it covers the nav button. Kinda handeled it. Still not nearly as perfect. Organising code better than I used to but still it's not nearly perfect. This project wasn't too hard but it was time consuming.

### Continued development

Responsivnes of the site is not the best. It works well on specific widths, but in-between transitions are BAD.
Like, really bad. Need to improve on that. I should definetely learn more about semantic HTML markup and stop doing pretty much everything with divs. Also, CSS file has A LOT of repetition that I should have organised better, for example with buttons. I should make a plan before starting the project instead of doing it as I go. Go with the flow metodology is not good for this type of project and I am fully aware of that.

### Useful resources

Did not use any, but I should have, maybe this code wouldn't be such mess.
